# ObjectToJson
This code helps to prepare a nested JSON from a C# Object.
This function app code serializes an Object into a nested JSON. I've created a class name Object.cs which has all the variables set. 
GetData.cs is the funaction app, that has the format that is set and converts the C# object to a nested JSON.
